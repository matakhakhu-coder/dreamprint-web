| Model | claude-sonnet-4-6 (or latest available at time of Phase 9) |
| Config Key Path | `DEVIANT.integrations.anthropic.apiKey` |
| Output Path | `content/[slug]-annotations.json` |
| Flag Key | `annotationsSimulated` |
| Status | `null` — TBC |

### Search Engine — External (Phase 2 upgrade path)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Service Purpose | Full-text search across all chapter content (Phase 1: client-side fuse.js) |

| Config Key Path | `DEVIANT.integrations.search.appId`, `DEVIANT.integrations.search.apiKey` |
| Flag Key | `searchExternal` |
| Status | `false` — client-side fuse.js is the default and requires no credentials |

---

## Feature Flags

All flags default to `true` (simulation) at project start.
Flipping a flag to `false` is the only code change needed to go live for that dependency.

| Flag Key | Controls | Resolves to `false` When |
|----------|----------|--------------------------|
| `annotationsSimulated` | Claude API annotation fetching — shows placeholder lore text | Anthropic API key placed in `DEVIANT.integrations.anthropic.apiKey` |
| `searchExternal` | Full-text search — client-side fuse.js vs external Algolia | Algolia App ID + API key confirmed and set in manifest |
| `adminSimulated` | Admin authentication — `localStorage` password vs real auth | Auth provider credentials confirmed |
| `multiBookMode` | Single book display vs bookshelf (Phase 8) | Activated in Phase 8 when second book is parsed |
